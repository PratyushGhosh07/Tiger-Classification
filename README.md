ALGORITHM:

Using this algorithm we are going to build custom deep image classifier using specific data. You can literally pull down any bunch of images from the web

and load it into this pipeline and you'll be able to use it to classify images as a zero or one binary classification type problem.

in this algorithm we are going to be very much focused on going through the end to end pipeline.

first we're going to get some data and load it into our pipeline.Then going to take a look at some pre-processing steps that we need to perform in order to 

improve how well our model performs, then we're going to build a deep image classifier using keras and tensorflow so we'll build a sequential deep neural 

network. After that we'll evaluate to test it. Finally we'll save down this model.
